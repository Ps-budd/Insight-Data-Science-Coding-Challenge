# Problem
A newspaper editor was researching immigration data trends on H1B(H-1B, H-1B1, E-3) visa application processing over the past years, trying to identify the occupations and states with the most number of approved H1B visas. She has found statistics available from the US Department of Labor and its [Office of Foreign Labor Certification Performance Data](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm#dis). But while there are ready-made reports for [2018](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/PerformanceData/2018/H-1B_Selected_Statistics_FY2018_Q4.pdf) and [2017](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/PerformanceData/2017/H-1B_Selected_Statistics_FY2017.pdf), the site doesn’t have them for past years. 

As a data engineer, you are asked to create a mechanism to analyze past years data, specificially calculate two metrics: **Top 10 Occupations** and **Top 10 States** for **certified** visa applications.

Your code should be modular and reusable for future. If the newspaper gets data for the year 2019 (with the assumption that the necessary data to calculate the metrics are available) and puts it in the `input` directory, running the `run.sh` script should produce the results in the `output` folder without needing to change the code.

# Input
Raw data could be found [here](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm) under the __Disclosure Data__ tab (i.e., files listed in the __Disclosure File__ column with ".xlsx" extension). The **File Structure** docs can be found in the website.
For convenience, the Excel files have been converted into a semicolon separated (";") format and placed them into this Google drive [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Nti6ClUfibsXSQw5PUIWfVGSIrpuwyxf?usp=sharing).

The program takes **semicolon separated** files as input, adhering to the file structure given on the website.

Few pointers on input file,
  * The input has to be a single file named h1b_input.csv.
  
  * The input file has to be utf8 encoded (please convert xlsx to csv before providing input).
  
# Output
My program creates 2 output files:
* `top_10_occupations.txt`: Top 10 occupations for certified visa applications
* `top_10_states.txt`: Top 10 states for certified visa applications

Each line holds one record and each field on each line is separated by a semicolon (;).

Each line of the `top_10_occupations.txt` file contains these fields in this order:
1. __`TOP_OCCUPATIONS`__: The occupation name associated with an application's Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) code.
2. __`NUMBER_CERTIFIED_APPLICATIONS`__: Number of applications that have been certified for that occupation.
3. __`PERCENTAGE`__: % of applications that have been certified for that occupation compared to total number of certified applications regardless of occupation. 

The records in the file are sorted by __`NUMBER_CERTIFIED_APPLICATIONS`__, and in case of a tie, alphabetically by __`TOP_OCCUPATIONS`__.

Each line of the `top_10_states.txt` file contains these fields in this order:
1. __`TOP_STATES`__: State where the work will take place.
2. __`NUMBER_CERTIFIED_APPLICATIONS`__: Number of applications that have been certified for work in that state.
3. __`PERCENTAGE`__: % of applications that have been certified in that state compared to total number of certified applications regardless of state.

The records in this file are sorted by __`NUMBER_CERTIFIED_APPLICATIONS`__ field, and in case of a tie, alphabetically by __`TOP_STATES`__. 

Depending on the input (e.g., see the example below), there may be fewer than 10 lines in each file. There, however, will not be more than 10 lines in each file.

Percentages are rounded off to 1 decimal place. For instance, 1.05% is rounded to 1.1% and 1.04% is rounded to 1.0%. Also, 1% is represented by 1.0%

# Approach
My steps to solve this problem were,
  read file contents line by line
  understand schema from header
  clean data row if necessary
  insert required data into dictionary
  sort dictionary
  write data to output file
  
### Version 1:
At first, as part of rapid prototyping, I read the contents of the file and added the required counts to a dictionary and then wrote results to output file. I chose dictionary data structure as it perfectly suits the problem, we need counts of each occupation and state, with occupation as key(needs to be unique) and counts as value.

But later on inspection of data, I found that all the data is not clean and data parsing fails for some rows. So I cleaned the data before adding it to the respective dictionaries. I wrote a custom function to parse the data accordingly.

### Version 2:
When looking at the data, I found that many rows have occupation names as different strings even though they belong to same soc code. This results in incorrect counts and inaccuracies. It makes more sense to choose a column like soc code(with unique value for occupations) as key of the dictionary.

For example, few rows have `MARKETING MANAGER` as soc name while few have `MARKETING MANAGERS` as soc name but all those rows have the same soc code `11-2021`. Version 1 counts these rows as different rows therefore producing inaccurate counts.

So, I revised my approach by considering soc code as keys and a dictionary of soc name and its counts as value. I used this complex dictionary of dictionary to get more accurate counts on occupations. While solving the problem with this approach I figured, soc code column data for few rows is not in format, so I cleaned those rows and then inserted. 

I understand that I would be increasing the code complexity, run time and space by implementing version 2 but this version gives more accurate results and much intuitive intrepretation of occupation names. The run time did not increase drastically when changing from version 1 to version 2 for this dataset. 

Counting top states would remain same in both versions as the state names are clean and follow the format except for missing values.

# Run Instructions
I used python3 for solving this challenge and used only the **`sys`** standard library for command line arguments needed for my script.
Running the **`run.sh`** file in the project root directory will run my script and produce the results in the specified format in specified folder.

# Tests
Please run the **`run_tests.sh`** script to run all the tests. The results are stored in **`results.txt`** in the same directory.
